<blockquote>
<p>I have more than 5 Years of experience in Java SE/Java EE development and design, including 3 years of huge-scale JAVA program development experience with solid knowledge of JAVA enterprise and JAVA core programming, including but not limit to Web server development expertise. I’ve served as a senior Java developer on a major project for Alcatel-Lucent Telecom Company(merged by Nokia now) with the main responsibilities of designing and architect new features requested by customer for the product which is a core network management system.<br>
Currently, I’m severing to a relatively small but pretty dynamic and vibrant company which going to IPO.<br>
My responsibilities include witting technical architecture document and monitoring projects schedules, as well as providing development guideline,etc.<br>
Besides Java,  I am also a omnivorous developer and am familiar with Groovy, Python and Linux shell script language, as well as using front-side framework like Angular.JS, Javascript, and JQuery.<br>
Currently I’m on a <a href="https://github.com/flying3615/cv">project</a> which is constructed by <a href="https://jhipster.github.io/presentation/#/">Jhipster</a> as full-stack tech, which is a web crawler to find <a href="http://Seek.co.nz">Seek.co.nz</a> jobs by different programming languages.<br>
With the ElasticSearch, it can find the suitable job much easier than Seek itself.<br>
I’m also a big fan of Scala and Kotlin, moderner languages than Java, supporting pure functional programming and making concurrent programming much easier.<br>
I’ve used Scala and its serial tech stack libraries to develop a <a href="https://github.com/flying3615/SearchEngine">small full inverted index searcher</a> for my GD homework</p>
