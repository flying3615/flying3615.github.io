        <p class="lead">My imagination has always been an incredible driving force in my life, and has an influence on
            almost everything I do.</p>
        <p>
            Growing up, I was enormously captivated by the world of fiction and what was capable within it.
            Over time, the fact that one persons simple creative idea could be moulded into something so exciting,
            engaging and capable of global impact has impressed and inspired me to pursue my own path in the creative
            arts through the use and integration of information technologies.
